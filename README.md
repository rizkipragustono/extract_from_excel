# Extracting Names and Phone Numbers from Excel
## Project Description
An Excel file contained personal information for each individual spread across multiple rows. The task involved extracting only the names and phone numbers from this unstructured format. Phone numbers were standardized to include the correct country code based on each customerâ€™s location. The data was converted using a Python script, which can be reused to update the dataset efficiently whenever new records are added.

## Summary
- Extracted names and phone numbers from a multi-row Excel format and standardized phone numbers with country codes.
- Automated the process using a reusable Python script for efficient future updates.
